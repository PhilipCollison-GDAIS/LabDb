LabDb is a project for administrating a server room.

There is a Webapp and a Server Database.

If you wish to host LabDb with XAMPP, then you must add
"C:\repo_path\LabDb\Html" as the document root. To do this, go to
C:\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf and set the DocumentRoot variable
to be your repository's Html folder.
